# Degree4Free

Many students lack the financial means to pursue higher education, often limiting their options to local, public institutions. The process of finding suitable programs and corresponding scholarships is complex and time-consuming, requiring months of dedicated research across various platforms, often in multiple languages.

Degree4free provides a unified platform that bridges the gap between university courses and available scholarships. By integrating a graph database, our website connects students with relevant funding opportunities tailored to their chosen programs. The platform simplifies the search process, allowing users to filter courses by rankings, topics, and other criteria, while automatically matching and displaying applicable scholarships based on their profile.
